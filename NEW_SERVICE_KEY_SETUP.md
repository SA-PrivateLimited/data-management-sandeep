# ✅ New Firebase Service Account Key - Setup Complete

## 📋 What Was Done

1. ✅ **Copied new service account key** to correct location:
   - From: `~/Downloads/android-app-data-collect-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-d7eed65481.json`
   - To: `backend-server/servicesAccountsKey.json`

2. ✅ **Verified file is protected**:
   - File is in `.gitignore`
   - Will NOT be committed to git
   - Safe from accidental exposure

3. ✅ **Validated the key**:
   - Project ID: `android-app-data-collect`
   - Client Email: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@android-app-data-collect.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

## 🔒 Security Status

**✅ Protected:**
- File is in `.gitignore`
- Not tracked by git
- Safe to use locally

## 📁 File Location

```
backend-server/servicesAccountsKey.json
```

## ✅ Ready to Use

The backend server will automatically use this key when you run:
```bash
cd backend-server
npm start
```

Or:
```bash
./start-server.sh
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Never commit this file** - It's in `.gitignore`
2. **Don't share publicly** - Contains private keys
3. **Keep it secure** - Only on your local machine
4. **Rotate if exposed** - If accidentally shared, create a new one

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Service account key is ready
2. ✅ Backend server can use it
3. ✅ File is protected from git
4. ✅ You can start the backend server

## 📝 Old Key

If you had an old key, it's been replaced. The old one should be:
- Deleted from Firebase Console (if you want to be extra secure)
- Or just left inactive (it will expire eventually)

The new key is now active and ready to use!
